## Predicting Housing Prices with Multiple Linear Regression
Data source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/housing-prices-dataset/data

This project uses the multiple linear regression statistical method to predict the price of a house based on certain factors like house area, bedrooms, number of stories, nearness to mainroad, etc. 
<br>**Note: The dataset used has no specific mentions of a real-life city or neighbourhood that it is based on. We also do not know what currency the Price variable is in.
